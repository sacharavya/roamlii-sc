The Barra MacNeils: An East Coast Christmas,"The Barra MacNeils - An East Coast Christmas is a musical potpourri of traditional MacNeil family favourites gleaned from Christmas ceilidhs, midnight masses and the general festive frolic that accompanies each holiday season. With their captivating vocals, distinctive harmonies and extraordinary musicianship, The Barra MacNeils inject new life and energy into the sights and sounds of Christmas, prompting the Halifax Daily News to describe them as “a treasure of the East Coast, rich with tradition and unmatched in ensemble performance”; and the Globe & Mail to name the recording on which this tour is based “one of the best five Christmas albums of all time!” The five MacNeil siblings - Lucy, Boyd, Stewart, Kyle and Sheumas - combine on a vast array of instruments including accordian, guitar, piano, fiddle, bodhran, mandolin, banjo, Celtic harp, tin whistles, bouzouki, flute … all underpinned by the nimble-fingered Jamie Gatti on bass. The result is a sound that is unmistakably The Barra MacNeils, one moment a rousing chorus, then a hauntingly beautiful Gaelic ballad, the next a flurry of foot-stomping instrumentals, which of course pulls one then another into a step-dancing revelry.

In the years since, this work has only grown in alarming relevance, as far-right movements gain traction around the world. Hill returns with a revised and expanded edition that draws attention to recent fascist activity, and the important work being done to combat it.

Shawn Desman Back to Life Tour Charlottetown,"Shawn Desman comes from a groundbreaking era of Canadian music that paved the way for the next generation of artists we see today. With a deep history of success, Desman exploded onto the scene, making waves across the country with his signature sound and style. He left a lasting mark on an entire generation of Canadians, earning a Platinum-selling album, five Platinum certified singles, multiple chart-topping radio hits, and a slew of awards, including a JUNO for R&B/Soul Recording of the Year, three MMVAs, and multiple SOCAN Awards for songwriting. In 2023, Desman made an unprecedented return to the stage, headlining the OVO All Canadian North Stars show and releasing his Top 10 radio smash “Maniac,” which catapulted him back to the forefront of the industry. What followed was a whirlwind of national media coverage, chart climbs, and viral moments that reached hundreds of millions of viewers across the country— reminding everyone why he remains one of Canada’s most celebrated music success stories. Desman has continued his momentum into 2025 with another multi-format Top 10 hit, “Body” featuring Jamie Fine. The song’s crossover success is a testament to his ability to evolve while staying true to the sound that made him a household name. With sold-out shows, massive streaming numbers, and continued viral traction, Desman’s staying power has never been more evident.",https://www.showpass.com/shawn-desman-back-to-life-tour-charlottetown/,$56.00 CAD,https://dcm1eeuyachdi.cloudfront.net/fit-in/3840x3840/filters:quality(100):format(webp)/media/images/events/whitecap-entertainment/img-banner/a54e1d3a-016.png,"[""https://dcm1eeuyachdi.cloudfront.net/fit-in/3840x3840/filters:quality(100):format(webp)/media/images/events/whitecap-entertainment/img-banner/a54e1d3a-016.png""]",America/Halifax,"[""Whitecap Entertainment""]",,96 Kensington Rd,Charlottetown,Prince Edward Island,,Canada,,,,https://www.showpass.com/o/whitecap-entertainment/,,"[""November 7, 2025, 8:00 PM AST""]"

"Classic Albums Live Performs: Pink Floyd, Wish You Were Here","Classic Albums Live takes the greatest classic rock albums and recreates them live on stage - note for note, cut for cut. “CAL are curators,” says founder Craig Martin, “These albums are historic and stand the test of time and CAL honours these recordings and their fans by delivering performances that sound exactly like the records”. To do this, CAL boasts an exceptional ensemble of performers, all of whom have graced music’s elite stages and collaborated with industry icons both in studio and on stage. “CAL is a modern-day orchestra,” Martin emphasizes, “utilizing the highest-level players whose unique ability to focus and execute with precision is essential to authentically recreating these records. All of the focus is on the music, there’s no distracting costumes or bad impersonations”. In 2023, CAL celebrated its 20th anniversary and has expanded its repertoire to include over 45 different records and delivers more than 200 performances annually across North America. Each CAL show offers two distinct experiences: a faithful rendition of the chosen record in the first half, followed by a dynamic set featuring the artist’s greatest hits. “We pay homage to the album in the first half, then let loose with the hits in the second,” explains Martin. “These albums and artists hold sacred places in people’s hearts, and as fans ourselves, we aim to exceed expectations and deliver an unforgettable experience. It’s this unwavering passion and dedication to authenticity that defines the very soul of CAL and resonates deeply with audiences.",https://www.showpass.com/o/festival-place/,$49.35 - $54.60 CAD,https://dcm1eeuyachdi.cloudfront.net/fit-in/3840x3840/filters:quality(100):format(webp)/media/images/events/festival-place/img-banner/56942df8-ba6.png,,MST,"[""Festival Place""]",,100 Festival Way,Sherwood Park,,,,,,,https://www.classicalbumslive.com/,,"[""Saturday January 31st, 2026, 7:30 PM MST""]"

Godspell,"Conceived and Originally Directed by John-Michael Tebelak. Music and New Lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. Directed by Bill Gabelhausen. Godspell, a musical based on the Gospel of Matthew, features a small group of people helping Jesus Christ tell different parables by using a wide variety of games, storytelling techniques and hefty doses of comic timing. An eclectic blend of songs, ranging in style from pop to vaudeville, is employed as the story of Jesus' life dances across the stage. Dissolving hauntingly into the Last Supper and the Crucifixion, Jesus' messages of kindness, tolerance, and love come vibrantly to life. Godspell was the first major musical theatre offering from three-time Grammy and Academy Award winner, Stephen Schwartz, and it took the world by storm. Led by the international hit, ""Day by Day,"" Godspell features a parade of beloved songs.",https://www.showpass.com/o/piedmont-college/,$7.33 - $12.63 USD,https://dcm1eeuyachdi.cloudfront.net/fit-in/3840x3840/filters:quality(100):format(webp)/media/images/events/piedmont-college/img-banner/803ecca5-97c.png,,EST,"[""Piedmont University""]",,500 College Dr,Demorest,,,,,,kblandin@piedmont.edu,https://www.showpass.com/o/piedmont-college/,,"[""Thursday, November 6, 2025, at 7:30 PM"", ""Friday, November 7, 2025, at 7:30 PM"", ""Saturday, November 8, 2025, at 7:30 PM"", ""Sunday, November 9, 2025, at 2:00 PM""]"
